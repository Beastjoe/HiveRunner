HiveRunner
==========

An Open Source unit test framework for hadoop hive queries based on JUnit4

==========

Welcome to the open source project HiveRunner. HiveRunner is a unit test framework based on JUnit4 and enables TDD development of HiveQL without the need of any installed dependencies. All you need is to add HiveRunner to your pom.xml as any other library and you're good to go.

- Source is currently subject to final internal review and will be pushed to this repo soon.
- A pom file will be attached for building the binary artifact and we will try to get the artifact up on maven central as soon as we can.

HiveRunner is under constant development. We use it extensively in all our Hive projects. Please feel free to suggest improvements both as Pull requests and as written requests.


A word from the inventors
---------
HiveRunner enables you to write Hive SQL as releasable tested artifacts. It will require you to parametrize and modularize HiveQL in order to make it testable. The bits and pieces of code should then be wired together with some orchestration/workflow/build tool of your choice, to be runnable in your environment (e.g. Oozie, pentaho, Talend, maven, etcâ€¦) 

So, even though your current Hive SQL probably won't run off the shelf within HiveRunner, we believe the enforced testability and enabling of a TDD workflow will do as much good to the scripting world of SQL as it has for the Java community.



Cook Book
==========

1. Include HiveRunner
----------
Add the dependency of HiveRunner to your pom file.  If you prefer Ivy, then you're currently on your own, but then again, since you're using Ivy, you probably know what to do anyway.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.klarna.hadoop</groupId>
        <artifactId>hadoop-hiveunit</artifactId>
        <version>0.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>


2. Look at the examples
----------
Look at the **HelloHiveRunner.java** reference test case to get a feeling for how a typical test case looks like. If you're put off by the verbosity of the annotations, there's always the possibility to use HiveShell in a more interactive mode.  The **SerdeTest.java** adds a resources (test data) interactively with HiveShell instead of using annotations.

Annotations and interactive mode can be mixed and matched, however you'll always need to include the @HiveSQL annotation e.g:

         @HiveSQL(files = {"serdeTest/create_table.sql", "serdeTest/hql_custom_serde.sql"}, autoStart = false)
         public HiveShell hiveShell;

Note that the *autostart = false* is needed for the interactive mode. It can be left out when running with only annotations.


3. Understand a little bit of the order of execution
----------
HiveRunner will in default mode setup and start the HiveShell before the test method is invoked. If autostart is set to false, the HiveShell must be started manually from within the test method. Either way, HiveRunner will do the following steps when start is invoked.

1. Merge any @HiveProperties from the test case with the hive conf
2. Start the HiveServer with the merged conf
3. Copy all @HiveResource data into the temp file area for the test
4. Execute all fields annotated with @HiveSetupScript
5. Execute the script files given in the @HiveSQL annotation

The HiveShell field annotated with @HiveSQL will always be injected before the test method is invoked.


Future work and Limitations
============
* Currently HiveRunner is only released for Hive 0.12. If the need arises branches could be created supporting other Hive versions, distributing them with maven classifiers.

* HiveRunner does not allow the add jar statement. It is considered bad practice to keep environment specific code together with the business logic that targets HiveRunner. Keep environment specific stuff in separate files and use your build/orchestration/workflow tool to run the right files in the right order in the right environment.

* HiveRunner runs Hive and Hive runs on top of hadoop, and hadoop has limited support for windows machines. Installing [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/ "Cygwin") might help out.

* Some of the HiveRunner annotations should probably be rebuilt to be more test method specific. E.g. Resources may be described on a test method basis instead as for a whole test case. Feedback is always welcome!
* The interactive API of HiveShell should support as much as the annotated DSL. Currently some features are not implemented in the HiveShell but only available via annotations.
 
* Clean up the logs

* HiveRunner currently uses in-memory Derby as metastore. It seems to be a real performance bottleneck. We are looking to replace it with hsqldb in the near future.

* Currently the HiveServer spins up and tears down for every test method. As a performance option it should be possible to clean the HiveServer and metastore between each test method invocation. The choice should probably be exposed to the test writer. By switching between different strategies, side effects/leakage can be ruled out during test case debugging.
